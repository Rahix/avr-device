//! Chip-Generic Interrupt Utilities
//!
//! For the most part, [crate::interrupt::free] is what you want:
//!
//! ```
//! avr_device::interrupt::free(|cs| {
//!     // Interrupts are disabled here
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! To access shared state, Mutex can be used:
//!
//! ```
//! use avr_device::interrupt::Mutex;
//! use core::cell::Cell;
//!
//! // Use Cell, if the wrapped type is Copy.
//! // Use RefCell, if the wrapped type is not Copy or if you need a reference to it for other reasons.
//! static MYGLOBAL: Mutex<Cell<u16>> = Mutex::new(Cell::new(0));
//!
//! fn my_fun() {
//!     avr_device::interrupt::free(|cs| {
//!         // Interrupts are disabled here
//!
//!         // Acquire mutex to global variable.
//!         let myglobal_ref = MYGLOBAL.borrow(cs);
//!         // Write to the global variable.
//!         myglobal_ref.set(42);
//!     });
//! }
//! ```
