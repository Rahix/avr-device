# Patches for the Watchdog Timer
#
# The control register has a different name between ATmega and
# ATtiny (WDTCSR vs WDTCR).
#
# - Make the control register read-write
# - Remove the overlapping WDP (Prescaler) field and replace
#   it with two separate fields.
# - TODO: See if svd2rust would support some kind of mask?
