# this isn't complete, but the MAN_ID_0 field is broken into bits, and has an
# associated 8-bit wide enum which is associated with bit 0 rather than the
# entire register. many other registers within the TRX24 are incorrectly split
# into bits, however they have not been patched yet as this is the only one
# which causes a build failure.
