## [0.3.1] - 2021-06-29
### Added
- Support for `ATmega8U2` ([#77]).
- Support for `AT90USB1286` ([#80]).
- Convert `static mut`s into `&mut` references inside `#[entry]` and interrupt
  handlers.  This behavior mirrors what `cortex-m-rt` does ([#79]).

## [0.3.0] - 2021-02-07
### Added
- Support for `ATmega4809` ([#63]).
- Support for `ATtiny841` and `ATtiny861` ([#67]).

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Updated the enumerated values for the SPI clock
  prescaler field ([#64]).
- **BREAKING**: Split the `EIMSK` register fields into per-bit fields on
  `ATmega328P` and `ATmega328PB` ([#74]).
- Switched to using the `svd interrupts` command for extracting
  a list of interrupts instead of parsing generated rust source
  files for this ([#69]).

### Fixed
- `ATmega64`: Fixed wrong field size for `UMSELn` fields in `USART` peripherals ([#64]).
- (via [`atdf2svd` v0.2.0]): Removed invalid enumerated values from all fields.
- Fixed an error in the 16-bit timer documentation ([#67]).
- Fixed the `PRR`, `PRR0`, and `PRR1` registers for `ATmega328P` and
  `ATmega328PB` wrongly being read-only ([#73], [#74])

[`atdf2svd` v0.2.0]: https://github.com/Rahix/atdf2svd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#020---2020-11-25


## [0.2.3] - 2020-10-19
### Added
- Support for `ATmega644`
- Support for `ATmega328PB`

### Changed
- Rewired svd-patching infrastructure to use upstream
  [`svdtools`][svdtools] instead of the locally vendored script.

### Fixed
- Made `ADCSRA` for ATtiny84 read-write.
- Made `TIFR` registers for ATmega timers read-write.

[svdtools]: https://github.com/stm32-rs/svdtools


## [0.2.2] - 2020-08-20
### Added
- Support for `ATmega168`
- Support for `ATmega48P`
- Support for `ATtiny84`

### Changed
- `#[entry]` causes a (readable) compile-error when attempting to build
  for non-AVR targets.
- `PINx` registers are now writeable, which enables efficient toggling
  of bits in the corresponding `PORTx` register.

### Fixed
- inline-assembly is now only emitted when building for AVR targets to
  prevent weird compiler errors where AVR instructions are emitted on e.g.
  x86_64.
- Fixed an issue in the build-system in preparation for the next svd2rust
  release.


## [0.2.1] - 2020-08-07
### Fixed
- Fixed `interrupt::free()` not working as advertised, because a wrong
  address was read.


## [0.2.0] - 2020-08-07
### Added
- Support for `ATtiny88`.
- An `asm` module with wrapper functions for various assembly
  instructions.

### Changed
- Various patches for `ATtiny85`, fixing up a lot of the remaining
  inconsistencies.
- `interrupt::enable()` is now unsafe, as it would otherwise be possible
  to enable interrupts safely inside a critical section.


## [0.1.1] - 2020-07-31
### Added
- Support for `ATmega2560`.

### Changed
- Patches for AVR timer/counter peripherals in `ATmega2560`, `ATmega328P`,
  `ATmega32U4`, `ATtiny85`.


## [0.1.0] - 2020-07-26
Initial release with support for `ATmega1280`, `ATmega328P`, `ATmega32U4`,
`ATmega64`, `ATmega8`, `ATtiny85`.
